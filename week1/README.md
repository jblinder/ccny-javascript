####Git/GitHub
For this class, we are going to be using a tool called `git`, as well as a website called `github.com` to host our assignments/projects. `git` is a version control system, which is basically a time capsule for a directory of files/folders. In `git`, the main directory that you want to keep track of is called a repository. You can use `Git` to keep track all the files in your directory, which is useful if you want to go back to previous versions, or try out a new idea without crufting up your project files.

`Github.com` is a social network that revolves around `git` repositories. It simplifies the process of hosting, sharing, and collaborating on code. You can choose to host all of your assignments for this class (for free) on www.github.com. Each week, I'll be updating our [course repository](https://github.com/jblinder/ccny-javascript), as well as the [course wiki](https://github.com/jblinder/ccny-javascript/wiki/), with the latest assignments and lecture notes.
