* AJAX
* APIs
* JSON

## Assignments


 1. Create a basic webpage that loads in at least 3 different html pages (or images) using AJAX.
 2. Email me a description of your final project.

## Final Project
**Due Week 14 (December 14th)**  
For your final project, you will be concepting, designing, and developing a full functioning web application. Your application can serve any purpose, however your site must:
* Use Javascript and JQuery
* Use at least 1 API (this could be Google analytics)

Alternatively, you can extend your midterm as your final project. If you decide to go this route, your final must be significantly revised.

Your application needs to be fully functional by the last day of class. You'll be giving a (roughly) 10 minute presentation that covers how you researched and executed your project, as well as demoing it to the rest of the class. 

Please email me a 1-paragraph project proposal before next class (November 23th). This should include:

* A basic description of your concept.
* Which features it will incorporate.
