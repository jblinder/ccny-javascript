### SimpleServer Application
I created a very basic application called "SimpleServer" to get around the MAMP permission issues on the university computers. It's in the Week9 GitHub folder. To use the application, drag the folder (it must be a folder, not a file) that you would like to start your webserver from on the "SimpleServer" icon. It should then open up your terminal and automate the process of starting the web server. You can visit http://0.0.0.0:8080 to access your project from there.
