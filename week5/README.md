* jQuery!

## Assignments

 1. Read chapter 7 (jQeury) in "Javascript & jQuery" by John Duckett.
 2. Visit the jQuery documentation page and try playing around with some of the different methods. http://jquery.com/
 3. Using either a previous assignment from class, update your Javascript code to use jQuery -- You can optionally create a new project that uses jQuery if you'd like (i.e. a todo list app). You should be using jQuery to handle all DOM manipulation methods, for instance `.html('some html')` instead of `document.getElementById("someId").innerHTML = "some html"` or `.click()` instead of the `onclick` attribute. Upload your revised website to your class github repository.
 4. Email me a 1 paragraph description of your midterm project.
